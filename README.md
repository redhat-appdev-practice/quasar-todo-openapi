# Quasar Todo OpenAPI (quasar-todo-openapi)

A Cloud-Native, Contract-First Application

## Use The Red Hat Developer Sandbox And DevSpaces (OPTIONAL)

Red Hat provides a small OpenShiftâ“‡ Kubernetes environment for free to developers. In this **Developer Sandbox** you
will have access to a cloud-based developement environment which can be automatically provisioned and used for this
workshop.

### Create a Red Hat Developers Account (if you do not have one)
1. Navigate to [Red Hat Developers](https://developers.redhat.com/)
2. Click on the **Log in** button in the top-right
3. Register for a new account

### Request A Developer Sandbox

1. Navigate to the [Developer Sandbox Landing Page](https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started)
2. Click on the "Launch your Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift" button and follow the prompts

### Create Your OpenShift DevSpace

1. Log in to your newly provisioned Developer Sandbox using the link you got via e-mail
2. Open "CodeReady Workspaces" by clicking on the 3x3 grid of squares in the top right ![Menu Screenshot](docs/Step_01_DevSpaces.png)
3. Click "Create Workspace"
4. Click "Custom Workspace" tab
5. Paste this URL for our DevFile and click "Load Devfile" ![DevFile Screenshot](docs/Step_02_DevSpaces.png)
6. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Create & Open"
7. After a short time provisioning, the cloud-based development environment will open with our starting code loaded.
   * You may notice that the user interface is very much like Visual Studio Code or Atom editors
8. Click "Yes, I trust" when prompted if you trust the authors of the code being loaded ![Trust Code](docs/Step_03_DevSpaces.png)
9. You should now see the project loaded in your DevSpace ![Cloud IDE](docs/Step_04_DevSpaces.png)

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
yarn watch
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
yarn build
```

## Configure NPM Proxy Cache

Because everyone at the conference is using the same public IP, there is a chance that we will
hit the NPM rate-limit. If this happens, I have brought a computer which is running Sonatype Nexus
to act as an NPM Proxy/Cache

From your command-line, run the following commands:

```bash
npm config set registry http://192.168.1.97:8081/repository/npmjs/
npm config set always-auth true
npm login --registry=http://192.168.1.97:8081/repository/npmjs/
# Username: admin
# Password: npmpassword
# Email: (this IS public) anything@anydomain.com
yarn config set registry http://192.168.1.97:8081/repository/npmjs/
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-webpack/quasar-config-js).
